Introduction
------------
iOS is a simple mobile webapp that shows your location on a UK Ordinance Survey
1:50,000 map.

Usage
-----
To see the app in action, you need to be in the United Kingdom as it uses the UK OS
OpenSpace API to display the map. You also need a phone that supports the Geolocation API.
Once you're in the UK, point your mobile browser to:

Before you can host the app on your own website, you need to get an API key from the OS. Just add it
to index.html and away you go.
